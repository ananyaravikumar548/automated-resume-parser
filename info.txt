 1. Automated Resume Parser
🔍 What is it?

It's a web application where users can upload PDF resumes. The app automatically reads the resume and extracts important information like the candidate’s name, skills, and education.

⚙️ How does it work?

The user uploads a resume through a simple web interface (Flask).
The uploaded PDF is processed using:
pdfplumber – to extract raw text from the PDF.
spaCy (NLP) – to detect entities like names using machine learning.
Predefined keywords are used to match skills and education.
The extracted details are stored in a local database (like SQLite or PostgreSQL).
It displays a success message once the process is done.
